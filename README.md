This web application is a project for Harvard's CS50 class during week 9. 

Students are tasked to implement a website via which users could buy and trade paper stocks. 

IEX's API is used to grab real-time market data in order to fuel this app. 

This application allows for users to quote stocks, buy and sell stocks, view their trading history, and see their current portfolio in real-time.

All functions helpers.py were provided as starter code for this assignment and were not written by me. In addition, the login and logout functions were also provided by Harvard.
